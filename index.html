                The piece of land, for cremation of two younger sons and mother of tenth Guru of sikhs is the most expensive land ever, on this planet. It was in December 1705 when the two younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh Ji named Sahibzada Fateh Singh (less than six years old -born in 1699) and Sahibzada Zorawar Singh (just over eight - born in 1696) were slained by the Mughal authorities  for not renouncing their faith (after the attempt at bricking them alive in the foundation of the wall failed). They laid down their lives but did not bow before the tyranny of the Moghul government. On this place, the two martyred young sons of Guru Gobind Singh were cremated with full honours along with their grand mother, Mata Gujri. There is no parallel to the martyrdom of such young boys in the annals of human history.

                    Fatehgarh Sahib is a city and the headquarters of Fatehgarh Sahib district, in the north west Indian state of Punjab. It was previously known as Sirhind. The city of Fatehgarh Sahib is of special significance to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/" alt="Explore Sikhism" target="_blank">Sikhs.</a>

                    The word "Fatehgarh", means "Town of Victory", and is so called because in 1710, Sikhs under the leadership of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F77OhCZh3DU" alt="Baba Banda Singh Bahadur" target="_blank">Baba Banda Singh Bahadur</a> conquered the area and destroyed the mughal fort. Banda Singh Bahadur announced the establishment of Sikh rule in the city and an end to the tyranny of the Mughal rule which had spread terror and injustice to the people of the region.

                    The town is surrounded by four memorial gates, each in memory of four important figures from Sikh history associated with Sirhind. These are: Diwan Todar Mal, Nawab Sher Muhammed Khan, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur and Baba Moti Ram Mehra. Each of these individuals showed the harmony and brotherhood among people in those times.

                    This incident occurred after the  two younger sons (also known as chotte <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRgnmWrX80s" alt="A must watch saga" target="_blank">sahibzadey</a>) of <a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Guru_Gobind_Singh" alt="Guru Gobind Singh Ji" target="_blank">Guru Gobind Singh Ji</a> had been slained (after the attempt at bricking them alive in the foundation of the wall failed) by the Mughal authorities on the 12 December 1705 for not renouncing their faith. Their grandmother left for her heavenly abode at the news of the sudden and despicable execution of the innocent youngsters. Sahibzada Fateh Singh  was less than six years old (born in 1699) and Sahibzada Zorawar Singh was just over eight (born in 1696).

                    There was great commotion in the town of Sirhind. Everyone was furious at the atrocious crime. They were unanimous in their view that this heinous act would herald the doomsday of the Moghul Empire.
                    Wazir Khan, the then Faujdar or Governor of Sirhind, refused to allow the cremation of the bodies unless the land for the cremation was purchased by laying gold coins (ashrifs) on the required area (in standing position).

                    Todar Mal, a devotee of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, managed somehow to do the cremation. It is estimated that at least 78000 gold coins were required to buy the required land, only enough land on which to perform the last rites. The diwan produced the coins and bought the piece of land he needed for the cremation. He had to literally 'carpet' the piece of ground in gold coins. He cremated the three bodies and put the ashes in an urn which he buried in the land he had bought.

                Such savagery led to the destruction of Sirhind four years later. In 1710, after a pitched battle fought for two days the Sikhs raised a victory cry and razed Sirhind to the ground. Baba Banda Singh Bahadur announced the establishment of Sikh rule in Sirhind city and an end to the tyranny of the Mughal rule which had spread terror and injustice to the people of the region.
